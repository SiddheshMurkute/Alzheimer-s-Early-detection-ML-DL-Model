# Alzheimer’s Early Detection using Multimodal AI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive pipeline for Alzheimer’s detection. It compares traditional Machine Learning with Deep Learning and concludes with a **Fusion Model** that combines patient data (CSV) with MRI Brain Scans (Images).

## 📂 Project Structure & Workflow

To replicate the results, run the notebooks in the following order:

1. **01_data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Handles image resizing, normalization, and class mapping.
2. **02_ml_models.ipynb**: Uses **Random Forest** on flattened image data as a baseline.
3. **03_ann_model.ipynb**: A basic Neural Network to process data through dense layers.
4. **04_cnn_model.ipynb**: A **Convolutional Neural Network** designed to extract spatial features from MRI scans.
5. **05_fusion_model.ipynb**: The final Multimodal model combining CNN features with clinical data.

## 🤖 Models & Results

- **Traditional ML:** Random Forest (for baseline comparison).
- **Deep Learning:** ANN and CNN (using TensorFlow/Keras).
- **Fusion:** A Functional API model merging Image and Tabular data for higher accuracy.
